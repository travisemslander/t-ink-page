This is Dragon Masters series. I would give it a rating of four stars, and it’s about a king who wants to keep his dragons a secret… So he he has someone keep it a secret!
But then… a dark wizard’s magic makes the sun dragon sick! Read the book # 2
to find out, and make sure to read book # 1 first!

There’s twelve books. Here are six:
