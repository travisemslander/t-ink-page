This is the grand house, made all out of planks, nothing else. Inside it is a bunk bed and a enchantment table. It also has a giant attic with nothing. The rest of the bottom floor is just what a normal house has: a furnace, crafting table, anvil, and chests. it also has a iron golem on the roof. ![grand-house]

 This is me. I'm on the bottom of the splitscreen, and TheDude, my brother minecrafter, is on the top of the splitscreen. ![us]
